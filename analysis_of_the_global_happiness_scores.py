I am quite a beginner on plots and visualization, but would love to learn more. Any feedback could help me to learn and experience more :)

What we see clearly is, Sub-Saharan countries has very low Economy and Health. An by this, they have lowest scores of happiness most of the time.

# **Conclusion**

My analysis and graphs on the data shows that, there are some really big factors on Happiness such as Health, Family and Economy.

It's also visible that some Regions on world has averagely higher Scores than the others. For example, Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa has dramatic difference.
